# Kafka Connect HDFS Connector

`kafka-connect-hdfs3` is a [Kafka Connector](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect)
for copying data between Kafka and Hadoop HDFS 3.x clusters.

Documentation for this connector can be found [here](https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/kafka-connect-hdfs/hdfs3/index.html).

# Development

To build a development version you'll need a recent version of Kafka as well as a set of upstream Confluent projects, which you'll have to build from their appropriate snapshot branch. See the [FAQ](https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-connect-hdfs3/wiki/FAQ) for guidance on this process.

You can build `kafka-connect-hdfs3` with Maven using the standard lifecycle phases.
